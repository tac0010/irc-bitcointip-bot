irc-bitcointip-bot
==================

This Freenode IRC BitcoinTip bot is a Willie module designed to facilitate micro-payments of Bitcoin between IRC users. The receiving user does not need to have a Bitcoin address or an account with the BitcoinTip Bot in order to receive payments. It was inspired by NerfighterSean's BitcoinTip Reddit Bot.
